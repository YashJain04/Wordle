You will describe your game's visual design system using the techniques learned in labs/tutorials to outline the structural / recurring components
(headers, footers, scoreboard, play area, etc), colour palette, and fonts / sizes. The design system should be documented in `/docs/design_system.md`.

The games visual design contains a board with multiple squares which represents the area allocated to each specific letter. The styles such as colour palette
take on the classic "white-black" theme which stems from the wordle game itself. Furthermore, the colours as for correct letters, incorrect letters, and misplaced letters
as well as fonts also stem from the wordle game itself.

Other components on the website used are a button which allows the user to generate a new word and play the game again. The answer for the word can be seen in the console for accessibility.

Furthermore, there are other components as well such as the header and footer which simply represents the game name and extra information such as the associated assignment number.

Overall, using the components and techniques learned from class we were able to ensure that this design system allows for a clean, minimalistic interface that is easy to navigate.
